# Launch checklist (Abe)

Things the code can't do for us, in roughly the order to do them. Every service stays on its **free plan**: no paid upgrades or add-ons.

## 0. Repo and content
- [ ] Commit her source files to `main`: `/docs/source-content.md`, `/docs/brand/logo.png`, `/docs/brand/current-site-header.png`, `/docs/mockups/*.png`. Then update the copy deck and fallback content from them.
- [ ] Set `main` as the default branch on GitHub (Settings → General → Default branch).
- [ ] The repo is under `abrahamqdiaz-a11y`. If Shary is meant to own it, transfer it to her GitHub account before handoff and keep Abe as a collaborator.
- [ ] Shary approves `/docs/copy-deck.md` in writing (all medical wording is her responsibility under our agreement), and the "Needs review" list goes to a qualified professional.

## 1. Sanity (her account, free plan)
- [x] Project created: **AvidaLunaWebsite**, project ID `p388w82e`, dataset `production` (already set in `studio/sanity.cli.ts` and `studio/sanity.config.ts`). Skip Sanity's "Set up Sanity" wizard: the Studio already exists in `/studio`.
- [ ] Make sure the project is in **Shary's** Sanity account, with Abe invited as Administrator.
- [ ] Create an API token (Viewer) → `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN`.
- [ ] Deploy the Studio to `avidaluna.sanity.studio`:
      `cd studio && npm install && npx sanity login && npx sanity deploy`
- [ ] Import the starting content: `npm run seed:build` (from the repo root), then
      `cd studio && npm run seed` (`--replace` overwrites seeded documents with the same IDs).
- [ ] CORS origins (sanity.io/manage → API → CORS): `http://localhost:3000`, the Netlify preview URL, `https://www.avidaluna.com`. No credentials needed for the site; the Studio host is added automatically.
- [ ] Webhook (sanity.io/manage → API → Webhooks):
  - URL `https://www.avidaluna.com/api/revalidate` (add a second one for the preview URL while testing)
  - Dataset `production`, trigger on create, update, delete
  - Filter: `_type in ["service","addon","event","article","faq","pageText","siteSettings","testimonial"]`
  - Projection: `{_type}`
  - Secret: the same long random string as `SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET`
  - HTTP method POST, API version `v2025-02-19` or newer
- [ ] Check edits appear on the site in about a minute without a deploy.

## 2. Netlify (her account, free plan)
- [ ] Create the site in **Shary's** Netlify account from her GitHub repo. Build settings come from `netlify.toml`.
- [ ] Add every environment variable from the table below.
- [ ] Free plan: reportedly **300 credits/month; each production deploy costs about 15 credits, bandwidth about 20 credits/GB**, and sites pause if credits run out. Check the current numbers at netlify.com/pricing. Keep deploys rare: content changes go through Sanity, not deploys.
- [ ] Consider turning off automatic deploy previews for every push once review is done (Site configuration → Build & deploy), to save credits.

### Netlify Forms (Abe)
The contact form, the group-event request and "Pay at my visit" are Netlify forms (`contact`, `group-request`, `add-ons-at-visit`, defined in `public/__forms.html`).
- [ ] **Forms → Enable form detection.** Then redeploy once so Netlify registers the three forms (they should appear under Forms).
- [ ] **Project configuration → Notifications → Form submission notifications** (Netlify's docs also call it Forms → Submission notifications → Add notification): add an **Email notification** to `YourRNShary@gmail.com` for each of `contact`, `group-request` and `add-ons-at-visit` (or one for "Any form"). The `add-ons-at-visit` one tells Shary which add-ons to bring.
- [ ] Test each form on the deploy preview with a real-looking email and full sentences (Netlify's spam filter flags `test@test.com`). Missing submission? Look under **Spam submissions** first.
- [ ] Check the free-plan form submission allowance at netlify.com/pricing.

## 3. Stripe (her account)
- [ ] Shary creates her own Stripe account. Abe adds the **test** keys (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`).
- [ ] Webhook endpoint: `https://www.avidaluna.com/api/stripe/webhook`, event `checkout.session.completed` → `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
- [ ] Test with card `4242 4242 4242 4242` and the Stripe CLI:
      `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook` then `stripe trigger checkout.session.completed`.
- [ ] Turn on Stripe payment email notifications for Shary (Settings → Notifications).
- [ ] After approval, swap in the live keys and the live webhook secret, then redeploy once.
- [ ] **If Stripe doesn't approve her account, we switch to another processor (for example Square), whose fees may differ.** The code is ready for that: implement `AddOnPaymentProvider` in `src/lib/payments/`.
- [ ] Help her set up in-person card payments (in our agreement).

## 4. Mailchimp (Shary does this in her own account)
The site adds people through her public signup form (no API key, no access to her account). It sends only `EMAIL`, `FNAME`, `LNAME`, `SOURCE` and `OPTIN`:

| Where | `SOURCE` | `OPTIN` |
|---|---|---|
| /book step 1 (everyone who asks for a booking link) | `booking` | `yes` if they ticked the box, else `no` |
| /join | `join`, or `join:<event-slug>` if they picked an event | `yes` (required) |
| Contact form, box ticked | `contact` | `yes` |
| Group-event request, box ticked | `group` | `yes` |

- [ ] **Audience fields:** add two **Text** fields with the merge tags **`SOURCE`** and **`OPTIN`** (Audience → Settings → Audience fields and \*|MERGE|\* tags). They can be hidden on her signup form. `EMAIL`, `FNAME`, `LNAME` and `PHONE` already exist (the site no longer sends `PHONE`).
- [ ] **Turn off reCAPTCHA** on her signup form, or the site's background sign-ups will fail.
- [ ] **Decide on double opt-in.** If it's on, people must confirm by email before her automations reach them (including the booking-link email).
- [ ] **Automations** (need a paid plan such as Essentials; the free plan reportedly has none):
  - When someone joins with `SOURCE` = `booking`, send one email with the booking link (https://booking.hydreight.com/widget-business/an92x) and the add-ons page (https://www.avidaluna.com/add-ons). The site says "We'll email your booking link and visit details", so this one has to be live before launch.
  - Send the complimentary "Wellness Notes" only to contacts whose `SOURCE` starts with `join`.
  - Send newsletters only to `OPTIN` = `yes`. Everyone who books is on the list, so every campaign must use this segment.
- [ ] **Known limit:** Mailchimp's public form doesn't update people already on the list, so a returning client won't trigger the booking automation again.
- [ ] Contacts: everyone who asks for a booking link is now added, so check her plan's contact limit.
- [ ] Test on the deploy preview: request a booking link, join on /join, and tick the box on the contact form, each with your own email; check `SOURCE` and `OPTIN` on each contact.

## 5. Contact address
- [ ] `CONTACT_EMAIL` = `YourRNShary@gmail.com` (also the code default). It's shown on the site and in the forms' "Please email … instead" messages.
- [ ] Later (optional): swap it for a business address once the domain moves (env var + Sanity Contact info).
- [ ] **Sanity Studio → Page text → Join:** update the heading to "Wellness Notes from a Nurse" and the intro to "Thoughtful, nurse-led notes and practical reminders to support your long-term health, one intentional choice at a time. #LiveWellLonger". Don't re-run the seed; it would overwrite Shary's edits.

## 6. Hydreight
- [ ] Check that the booking link works: https://booking.hydreight.com/widget-business/an92x
- [ ] Ask Hydreight whether their booking email includes the client's email (needed for the future automation in `HANDOFF.md`).
- [ ] Ask how group-event guests each book and get screened.

## 7. QR codes and short link
- [ ] Her printed QR codes and `bit.ly/Avida-Luna` skip the intake form. Decide: repoint the bit.ly link to `/book`, and/or reprint QR codes. Files: `public/qr/join.png|svg` and `public/qr/book.png|svg` (regenerate with `npm run qr`).

## 8. Domain and launch
- [ ] Transfer the domain from Squarespace to a registrar in **Shary's** name.
- [ ] Point DNS to Netlify; set `www.avidaluna.com` as the primary domain.
- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_HIDE_TODOS=1` only after every TODO is resolved.
- [ ] After launch, check every redirect (`/about-me`, `/cart`, `/wellnesseducation`, `/faq-1`) returns 301, and add any other old URLs (blog posts) to `next.config.ts`.
- [ ] Submit `https://www.avidaluna.com/sitemap.xml` in Google Search Console (her Google account).

## 9. Handoff (in our agreement)
- [ ] Confirm Shary is owner and admin on every account (GitHub, Netlify, Sanity, Stripe, Mailchimp, domain).
- [ ] Send `HANDOFF.md` and `/docs/how-to-edit.md`.
- [ ] Hold the walkthrough call.
- [ ] Final payment is due after she approves the site and receives the handoff.

## 10. Collect from Shary
- [ ] Her current site text (`source-content.md`), including her About story and mission quote, word for word
- [ ] Photos (starting with `SharyPic.jpg`), and photos for each add-on
- [ ] Higher-res or vector logo (SVG)
- [ ] Instagram and Facebook links
- [ ] Confirmed drip names and prices (do they match Hydreight?), and whether glutathione / B-complex stay listed
- [ ] Recovery Ritual contents and duration
- [ ] Service area and travel fee
- [ ] Cancellation and refund policy
- [ ] Visit length
- [ ] The PubMed link for her article
- [ ] Whether anyone else attends appointments ("our caring team" on the current site)
- [ ] Her written approval of `/docs/copy-deck.md`
